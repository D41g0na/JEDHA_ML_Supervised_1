# JEDHA_Projet_UBER

This is a mandatory project for my unsupervise_machine_learning certification:

"Uber already has data about pickups in major cities. Your objective is to create algorithms that will determine where are the hot-zones that drivers should be in."


### Prerequisites

pip install -r requirements.txt
download uber-raw-data-apr14.csv

### Installation

Once you have the prerequisites, You can run the IPython Notebook JEDHA_projet_UBER.ipynb.

The model could take some time to be fit, then you will have a plot for each test.
